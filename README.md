# Self-Learning-Companion-Web-Application
Built a Flask-based platform for solo learners to upload files, track study time, and visualize learning via graphs. Added a smart search tool to fetch external study materials (PDF, DOCX, etc.) directly within the app, making self-study more organized and efficient.

**A smart digital workspace for solo learners**  
Track what you read, how long you read, and explore new content — all from one powerful dashboard.
